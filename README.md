## Abstract
The evolution of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reshaping how online businesses interact with their customers. One of its main uses in e-commerce is the ability to offer tailored experiences to individual users. This report explores how AI-based personalization tools influence consumer buying behavior in e-commerce. It discusses the contribution of systems like recommendation engines, predictive models, and customized content in shaping user engagement, boosting conversions, and improving satisfaction levels. Using literature, case studies, and simple SQL-based data representation, this study evaluates the impact and prospects of personalization powered by AI.

## 11. SQL Code Sample (Recommendation Example)

Below is a simple SQL example that simulates user-product purchase data and shows how recommendations can be generated using basic filtering and joins. This is a beginner-friendly version to show how personalization could be done at a basic level.  

```sql
-- Create table for purchases
CREATE TABLE Purchases (
    UserID VARCHAR(10),
    ProductID VARCHAR(20)
);

-- Insert sample data
INSERT INTO Purchases VALUES 
('UserA', 'Product1'),
('UserA', 'Product3'),
('UserA', 'Product5'),
('UserB', 'Product2'),
('UserB', 'Product3'),
('UserB', 'Product5'),
('UserC', 'Product1'),
('UserC', 'Product2'),
('UserC', 'Product4'),
('UserD', 'Product2'),
('UserD', 'Product4'),
('UserD', 'Product5');

-- Find products purchased by a specific user (e.g., UserA)
SELECT ProductID
FROM Purchases
WHERE UserID = 'UserA';

-- Find similar users who bought the same products as UserA
SELECT DISTINCT p2.UserID
FROM Purchases p1
JOIN Purchases p2 ON p1.ProductID = p2.ProductID
WHERE p1.UserID = 'UserA' AND p2.UserID <> 'UserA';

-- Recommend products that similar users bought but UserA has not
SELECT DISTINCT p2.ProductID
FROM Purchases p1
JOIN Purchases p2 ON p1.ProductID = p2.ProductID
WHERE p1.UserID = 'UserA' AND p2.UserID <> 'UserA'
AND p2.ProductID NOT IN (
    SELECT ProductID FROM Purchases WHERE UserID = 'UserA'
);
