## üìä Beginner-Level Python Example  

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Simulated product purchase data
data = {
    'Product': ['Product 1', 'Product 2', 'Product 3', 'Product 4', 'Product 5'],
    'User A': [1, 0, 1, 0, 1],
    'User B': [0, 1, 1, 0, 1],
    'User C': [1, 1, 0, 1, 0],
    'User D': [0, 1, 0, 1, 1]
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Count total purchases per product
df['Total Purchases'] = df.drop('Product', axis=1).sum(axis=1)

# Plot bar chart of product popularity
plt.figure(figsize=(6,4))
plt.bar(df['Product'], df['Total Purchases'], color='skyblue')
plt.title("Total Purchases per Product")
plt.xlabel("Products")
plt.ylabel("Number of Purchases")
plt.show()
